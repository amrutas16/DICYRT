	\section{Abstract}

The project aims to achieve two different goals. The core idea is to find food and restaurants based on Yelp reviews and Google Places reviews. One of the goals is to create a food-based word cloud for a specific restaurant based on offline data obtained from Yelp and data streamed from Google Places reviews. The other goal is to search for a restaurant based on a particular food and location.
